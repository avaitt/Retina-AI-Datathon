# Retina-AI-Datathon

The aim of this datathon was to gather eCommerce insights and leverage analytics to diagnose business strengths in terms of customer behaviors. 

I was charged with analyzing visualizations that projected customer lifetime value (LTV) over 5 year and 10 year periods. By analyzing specific quantiles of my subset, I came to the conclusion that my client (the eCommerce company in question) should target higher spenders and incentivize to those customers who fall in the top 60% of high-spenders.

I also gathered insights on how the lifetime revenue (LTR) of a customer weighs against a customer's acquisition cost (CAC). In doing so, I identified which subset of customers were generally unprofitable (i.e. not worth marketing to) and recommended acquiring higher lifetime value customers at the outset by dissolving any subscription based business models. After doing so, I created a pipeline to automate the aforementioned tasks to fit various eCommerce scenarios. 

Lastly, I generated my own visualizations to conclude that my client should not pour resources into customers that historically have not been active buyers. By recognizing that there exists severe customer retention loss year-on-year, I recommended that my client consistently look for newer customers in order to stay profitable.
